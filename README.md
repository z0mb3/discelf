# DiscELF for BD-J [ps5-jar-loader](https://github.com/hammer-83/ps5-jar-loader)

## Description
DiscELF is a JAR payload for the [ps5-jar-loader](https://github.com/hammer-83/ps5-jar-loader).
It will let you pick and execute a ELF file.
Those ELF files need to be in the 'elf-payloads' folder in the root of your BD-J disc.

## Compile
Compile it with the ps5-jar-loader project.
Put it in the xploit folder as a subfolder and add it inside of the xploit/pom.xml as an additional module

## Thanks and credits toâ€¦

project specific to:
[cryonumb](https://github.com/cryonumb/elfloader)  - For his jar payload for elfloader - most of the DiscELF code is a copy paste from it
[hammer-83](https://github.com/hammer-83) - For his jar loader project including his BDJ/PS5 sdk

And in general  a big THX to everyone involved in the PS5 HB scene
